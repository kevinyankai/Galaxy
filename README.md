Project Introduction:

The original intention of our project is to pay tribute to the spirit of open source. After some officially provided data sets are processed and filtered, they are displayed to users in a previewable form. We also have a search function to accurately locate data resources through the file CID and display The data set where the current data is located.
The user believes that the current file content meets his needs, then he can choose whether to encourage and support us in the form of rewards.
In addition, we also plan to cache part of the hot data directly on our own server to provide refreshed retrieval services.
